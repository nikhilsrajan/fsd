"""The image definition registry, mirroring `fsd.model.registry`'s layout:

          image.json           the resolved definition + the digest + the AML asset it became

          _aml.json            [optional] the AML asset it currently is, if it was rebuilt
        v8/ ...

Built on `fsd.registry._core` (spec 56 §7 Q1) -- version allocation, `_aliases.json`,
`_complete.json` and the collision retry are the same mechanism `fsd.model.registry` uses,
generalized rather than shared by import (see `_core`'s docstring for why).

**The registry path is an argument, always**: every function here takes `registry=`;
nothing under `src/fsd/` reads it from config or an environment variable.
