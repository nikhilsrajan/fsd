"""Raster primitives (rasterio).

`rio_open` is the one sanctioned exception to "all I/O via fsd.storage": rasterio reads pixels
through GDAL's VSI layer, not fsspec. It is a plain passthrough for local paths and routes an
`abfss://`/`az://` source through GDAL's `/vsiadls/` handler with a fresh access token.
Writing to a remote path raises.

    at the same time (e.g. `rasterio.merge` over N COGs).

    **Why this exists.** `rio_open` enters a
    `rasterio.Env` *per dataset* and exits it on `close()`. rasterio's env stack is LIFO and
    thread-local: the first `Env.__enter__` records `_has_parent_env=False`, and *its* `__exit__`
    sets `local._env = None`. So holding N `rio_open` handles and closing them in creation order
    tears down the root env first, and the next `close()` raises
    `EnvError: No GDAL environment exists`. With 300 merge inputs that is a hard failure.
    `rio_open` is for ONE scoped dataset (`with rio_open(p) as src:`); this is for N.

    Returns a null context for all-local `paths`, like `rio_open`.
    Open the datasets with `rasterio.open(to_vsi(fp))` *inside* the `with`, and keep every pixel
    read inside it too: the env carries the credentials.
