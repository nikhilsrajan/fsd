# Manual runbook — datacube throughput benchmark (spec 11 · Part 1)

How to run the **parallelism-sweep** benchmark yourself, re-run it after an
optimization, and read the result. This is the reusable baseline for the
datacube-speed track (TODO #15): *how does the wall-time to build many datacubes
scale with build parallelism, and where does the time go per step?*

It runs the **real** Snakemake workflow (`run_create_datacube` path) over a fixed
set of geometries against the real `satellite_benchmark/` tiles — no synthetic data,
no downloads. Read-conflict logging is **not** here (that's Part 2 / spec 12); this
measures throughput + per-step timing + static grid×tile overlap.

## 0. Prerequisites

- Dev env active: from `fsd/`, `source .venv/bin/activate` (deps incl. `matplotlib`,
  `snakemake` are in `.venv`, not system Python).
- Data present at the workspace root (parent of `fsd/`):
  - `satellite_benchmark/sentinel-2-l2a/catalog.parquet` — the 1-year Ethiopia download.
  - `shapefiles/100_random_grids.geojson` — the 100 res-11 S2 grids, `id` column.
- Everything is parametrised by module constants at the top of
  `benchmarks/datacube_throughput_sweep.py` (`ROOT`, `CATALOG`, `GRIDS`, window, bands).
  Edit those if your paths/window differ.

## 1. Run it

From `fsd/` (the repo root):

```bash
# quick smoke — 3 grids, cores 1 & 2 (~30 s), proves the chain end-to-end
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/datacube_throughput_sweep.py --smoke

# full baseline — 100 grids, cores 1,2,4,6,8,10 (~25–40 min on a 10-core Mac)
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/datacube_throughput_sweep.py

# custom: e.g. 40 grids, only 1/2/4 cores, 2 repeats (min wall kept per setting)
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/datacube_throughput_sweep.py --n-grids 40 --cores 1,2,4 --repeats 2
```

Flags: `--cores` (comma list), `--n-grids N` (first N grids), `--repeats R`, `--smoke`,
and `--report-only` (rebuild `report.md` from the saved `stats.json`, reusing the figures —
no sweep; handy after tweaking the report text).

The harness prints a **live progress line every ~10 s** while each setting builds, plus a
running sweep-wide ETA, e.g.:

```
[sweep] START 6 runs × 100 grids | cores=[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10] repeats=1
[progress] run 1/6 cores=1 [########----------------] 33/100 | 3.1m elapsed | ETA ~6.2m
[sweep] DONE run 1/6 cores=1 rep=0: total=9.5m built=100/100 rc=0 | sweep ETA ~40m
```

> **Long run?** Launch detached and watch the log:
> ```bash
> nohup .venv/bin/python benchmarks/datacube_throughput_sweep.py > /tmp/sweep.log 2>&1 &
> grep -E "\[setup\]|\[progress\]|\[sweep\]|\[done\]" /tmp/sweep.log   # progress + ETA
> ```

## 2. What it does (the steps, in order)

1. **Setup once** — `create_datacube.setup(...)` slices the big catalog per grid
   (`TileCatalog.filter`) into `tests/outputs/throughput_sweep/<dates>/<id>/catalog.parquet`
   + `geometry.geojson`, and writes one `input.csv`. (Skips grids with no intersecting
   tiles — that's why "n grids with tiles" can be < 100.)
2. **Characterize (static, no raster reads)** — reads each grid's `catalog.parquet`
   slice → the MGRS tiles it touches → grid×tile overlap (how many grids share each tile
   = *potential* shared reads) and the tiles-per-grid distribution (build heaviness).
3. **Sweep** — for each `cores` value (× `repeats`):
   a. **wipe** each grid folder's artifacts + `start.txt`/`done.txt` sentinels so
      Snakemake actually rebuilds (setup slices are kept);
   b. set `FSD_WRITE_TIMINGS=1` and run `runners.run_local(input.csv, cores=C)`
      (the real Snakemake local runner, jitter off);
   c. time the whole call = **total wall**; then **collect** per-grid `wall_seconds`
      (`done.txt − start.txt`) + the builder's `timings.json` sidecar (per-phase seconds).
4. **Aggregate + report** — per `cores`: throughput, speedup, efficiency, summed
   per-phase seconds, mean `load_images`/grid; write the report + stats + 4 plots.

**How the per-step timing works:** `build_datacube(write_timings=True)` times each phase
(missing_check · load_images · dst_crs · reference_profile · resample · stack · ops · save)
and drops a `timings.json` next to `datacube.npy`. It is **off by default**; the harness
turns it on for the whole run via the `FSD_WRITE_TIMINGS` env var (inherited by the task
subprocesses), so nothing else in the workflow needs to change.

## 3. Outputs

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `benchmarks/datacube_throughput_report.md` | the human report (regenerated every run) |
| `benchmarks/datacube_throughput_stats.json` | machine-readable — **diff this across runs** |
| `benchmarks/datacube_throughput_figures/*.png` | throughput, phase-breakdown, load_images, wall-vs-tiles |
| `tests/outputs/throughput_sweep/` | gitignored scratch (per-grid slices, sentinels, cubes) |

## 4. How to read it

- **Throughput vs parallelism table** — `speedup` = wall(cores=1)/wall(cores);
  `efficiency` = speedup/cores. Efficiency dropping well below 1 as `cores` climbs means
  extra processes are **not** buying proportional speed → contention. The **sweet spot**
  is the `cores` with the best total wall.
- **`mean load/grid (s)` column + the load_images plot** — the key contention signal: if
  the *same* per-grid `load_images` gets slower as `cores` rises (while compute phases stay
  flat), parallel reads are blocking each other. That number climbing is exactly the
  hypothesis Part 2 (spec 12) will confirm by logging every individual read.
- **`load_images frac`** — how much of the build is I/O. On this pipeline it dominates;
  that's why the speed work targets reads, not CPU.
- **wall-vs-tiles plot** — per-grid cost scales with how many MGRS tiles a grid straddles
  (1-tile grids are cheap; boundary grids that hit 2–4 tiles cost more).

---

## 5. Re-running after an optimization (the point of the harness)

1. Keep the current `datacube_throughput_stats.json` as the baseline (copy it aside).
2. Make your change (e.g. a tile-split from Part 3, or a read-caching tweak).
3. Re-run the **same** command.
4. Compare `total_seconds` / `mean_load_per_grid` / `efficiency` per `cores` between the
   old and new `*_stats.json`. Faster load_images at high `cores` with flat compute = the
   contention was reduced.

---

## 6. Notes & caveats

- **Cache: measured, not forced** (spec 11 decision). Runs are warm-as-is; no `sudo purge`.
  Re-running the same grids across settings can warm shared file blocks, but the grids read
  mostly-disjoint windows so reuse is limited. Precise cache-vs-contention separation is
  Part 2's job. If you want a colder comparison, `sudo purge` between runs (macOS) — but
  that is not required and not what the current report claims.
- **Setup time is excluded** from the swept total (setup runs once, up front). Only the
  build/`run_local` wall is timed per `cores`.
- **Cleanup:** the harness removes its own `.snakemake/` scratch; the
  `tests/outputs/throughput_sweep/` folder is gitignored — delete it to reclaim disk.
- Lower-level pieces are importable if you want to poke by hand:
  `from benchmarks.datacube_throughput_sweep import characterize, overlap_stats, run_sweep`
  (or drive `create_datacube.setup` + `runners.run_local` directly).
