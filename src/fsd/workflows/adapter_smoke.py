"""Node-side adapter-import smoke.

The ONE check the driver cannot do alone: whether the adapter (module:attr) actually
imports and its artifact actually loads **inside the real inference Environment** -- the
driver's own venv is not guaranteed to mirror the node's image (ADR 0002). Runs as a
single one-node job, once, before the N-node fan-out (`run_aml_inference`); a missing
`sklearn` or an un-importable adapter fails here in ~40-380s (one node's cold start)
instead of on every fan-out node.

No pipeline logic: fetch the staged bundle to scratch (reuses
`infer_shard.fetch_bundle_to_scratch`), check the bundle's declared requirements against this
Environment, `bundle.load` it (resolves the import -- since spec 44 usually from
the bundle's own `code/` -- and reads the artifact), and confirm `predict` is callable. Writes a `_status/*.json` (spec 24/36 shape).

Run as: python -m fsd.workflows.adapter_smoke <bundle_url> --status-url <url>
