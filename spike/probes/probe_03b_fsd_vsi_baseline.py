"""Probe 03b — fsd's `/vsiadls/` read of the SAME blob object probe 03 wrote.

Closes the one number probe 03 cannot produce. Probe 03 measured rslearn reading Azure blob
through an fsspec file object (21-24 MB/s on the first VM run). That figure means nothing on
its own -- it needs fsd's own route over the same object, on the same VM, in the same minute,
to be a comparison rather than a datum.

**This runs in fsd's venv (`.venv`), not the spike venv.** The charter keeps `.venv-rslearn`
free of fsd, which is exactly why probe 03's `q4_vs_fsd` skips: no single interpreter has both.
Two probes, one object, two environments -- that is the design, not a workaround.

## Why the comparison is the whole point

`fsd` routes remote rasters through GDAL's `/vsiadls/` handler with a refreshed
`AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (`src/fsd/raster/__init__.py:56-92`, spec 31). rslearn hands
rasterio an fsspec file object instead (`rslearn/utils/fsspec.py:157-179`) and never gives GDAL
a URL. Both work. fsd's route exists because GDAL's remote reader has optimizations -- range
caching, overview handling -- that a plain Python file object does not get. **Whether that
buys anything measurable is the open question in report section 4.1.1**, and it is the last
input to the Option B price.

## Procedure

1. Run probe 03 **with `--keep`** so the object survives.
2. Run this, in fsd's venv, pointing at the geotiff probe 03 left behind:
   `<dst-prefix>/raster_format/geotiff.tif` (`GeotiffRasterFormat.fname`,
   `raster_format.py:510`).

Usage (see `../RUNBOOK-rslearn-spike.md` Step 3c):

    python spike/probes/probe_03b_fsd_vsi_baseline.py \
        --out tests/outputs/rslearn_spike \
        --url "$AZ_ROOT/$AZ_SCRATCH_PREFIX/rslearn_spike/raster_format/geotiff.tif"

Reads only. Writes nothing to blob. Like probe 03, the result records the URL's *shape*, never
the URL -- this branch is a public MIT repo.
