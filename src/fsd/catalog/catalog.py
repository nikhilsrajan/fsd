"""TileCatalog — read/append/filter the downloaded-tile catalog.

Spec: specs/02-catalog.md

Columns: id (unique; the **canonical granule name** since spec 59 D3), acquisition_key
(identity of the physical observation, spec 59 D4), processing_version / processing_datetime
(spec 59 D8; null when the provider exposes none), source (comma-joined sorted set of the
sources that contributed files, unioned on append), collection (STAC collection id, e.g. "sentinel-2-l2a" -- spec 58 D12;
renamed from "satellite", which always held this), timestamp (UTC), s3url,
local_folderpath, files (comma-joined band filenames), cloud_cover, offset (the additive
declared radiometric offset for radiometry bands; 0 when a collection has no such concept),
scale (the declared multiplicative radiometric scale; 1.0 when a collection has no such
concept -- spec 58 D5.1, declared metadata only, never applied to pixels), nodata (the
declared nodata value; defaults 0), properties (JSON, the source item's STAC properties
verbatim -- spec 58 D12; carries facts like `sat:orbit_state` the D9 partition guard
needs, and nothing fsd interprets directly belongs here instead of a first-class column),
geometry (EPSG:4326).

⚠️ **No read-time back-compat shim (spec 58 D12, standing policy).** A catalog written
before this schema change is not patched up here -- re-download and re-ingest, never
silently default a missing column (see `read()`).
