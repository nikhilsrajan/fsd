"""`fsd.aml` -- the AML builder for `fsd.image.ImageDefinition`.

Spec: specs/56-image-definitions-and-registry.md

`fsd.image` is backend-agnostic by construction; this module is not. It is the only
place that shells out to `az`, and it is check-then-build:

1. resolve + digest the definition (`fsd.image.digest`),
2. look it up in the registry by digest,
3. confirm the AML asset the registry points at still exists (a deleted asset is stale),
4. on a miss: render the context and `az ml environment create`,
5. publish the (possibly new) definition, record the AML asset it became, set the alias.

`ensure_environment` never waits for the build to finish: an AML v2 image build is an
ACR task run, not an AML job, so it returns the version and the Studio URL immediately.

    `deploy`/`run_inference`/`verify_image` do (Opus review, 2026-08-27: this was the one
    public verb reaching the storage seam without configuring it). It is a **hardening, not a
    fix for a broken path** -- `adlfs` defaults to `anon=None`, which tries a credential
    first, so a registry read with `az login` in place already worked (verified on a real run,
    2026-08-27). What it buys is the failure mode: with `anon=False` a credential problem
    raises, instead of silently degrading to an anonymous read that returns nothing and looks
    exactly like "this definition is not registered yet" -- which would rebuild a 10-20 minute
    image on every call.
