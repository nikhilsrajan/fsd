"""Resolving and digesting an `ImageDefinition` (spec 56 D2).

Two functions: `resolve()` turns every moving reference into a fixed one -- a `git+...@main`
becomes `git+...@<40-char sha>`, a `path:` `fsd` becomes a wheel content digest, an
unpinned base tag becomes `@sha256:...` when it can be resolved and stays a tag (recorded
unresolved) when it can't -- and `digest()` hashes the result. `resolve()`'s output is
exactly `image.json`'s `definition` field (spec 56 D3).

**The exclusion list is a named constant** (`_DIGEST_EXCLUDE`), not an accident of what the
dataclass happens to carry: `name` never enters the payload, because renaming an image does
not change its contents (flytekit's `parameters_to_exclude`, spec 56 §8). `build_context`
is excluded from the payload as a path and replaced by `build_context_digest` -- a digest of
its file *contents*, never its location (flytekit nullifies `registry_config` for the same
reason: "a path that does not affect the image must not affect the key").
