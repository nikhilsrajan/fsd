# Spec 32 — MPC source (Sentinel-2 L2A) + processing-baseline harmonization

## Motivation

fsd's Azure/Batch endgame wants to read Sentinel-2 that already lives **on Azure as COGs**. MPC is
exactly that: a global S2 L2A archive (2016→present, Sen2Cor, COG) served from Azure West Europe —
the same region as `rise` storage. Sourcing from MPC:

1. **Deletes the `jp2→COG` conversion** (the heaviest, most fragile part of the CDSE path, spec
   25) — MPC assets are already COG, so a download is a pure byte-copy and a build can even stream
   them in place later (Phase 2).
2. **Forces us to handle the processing-baseline offset correctly** (#10). On 2022-01-25 ESA
   introduced baseline 04.00, which adds a `BOA_ADD_OFFSET` (−1000 for L2A reflectance) so
   `reflectance = (DN + offset) / 10000`. MPC does **not** harmonize this and does **not** expose it
   per-band in STAC. A datacube that median-mosaics pre- and post-2022 DN together is **silently
   wrong**. This spec fixes it band-aware, at the layer where it belongs.

Two integration facts from the codebase shape the design:

- **Band-flattening lives in `builder.flatten_catalog`** (tile-row → one row per band file), and
  **per-source-image loading is in the builder's `_add_image_metadata` / `images.load_images`**,
  which runs **before** the `ops.median_mosaic` op-chain. Harmonization must be applied there,
  per image — a datacube-level op is too late (the median would already have mixed baselines; a
  calendar window straddling Jan 2022 is the concrete failure).
- **The catalog schema is a fixed `COLUMNS` list** (`catalog/catalog.py`); the offset is an
  **additive** column (default 0 → CDSE rows and old catalogs are unaffected).

## Scope

**In (Phase 1, local, hotspot-friendly):**
- `sources/mpc.py` — a *general* MPC S2 L2A source (ROI→MGRS tiles, all bands), reusing the STAC
  discovery pattern; **only the test is narrow** (single tile / single band).
- The additive `boa_add_offset` catalog column + its derivation from `s2:processing_baseline`.
- The build-time, band-aware harmonization op (D2), applied per source image before the mosaic.
- `[mpc]` extra (`planetary-computer`); thin `api.download(source="mpc")` wiring.
- pytest (synthetic) + a single-tile/single-band runbook (real MPC, user-run).

**Out (named, deferred):**
- **Azure at scale** (download-to-`rise` / stream-in-place, output artifacts on blob) — **Phase 2 /
  spec 31**. Including the Phase-2 fork: *copy MPC COGs into `rise`* vs *stream MPC in place via
  `/vsicurl` and write only outputs to `rise`* (decided at the Phase-1→2 boundary).
- **Signed-URL expiry / re-sign** for long builds — a non-issue at Phase-1 scale (seconds); a
  Phase-2 concern (TODO).
- **Retrofitting CDSE with the same offset fix** — the column is additive and CDSE-ready, but
  wiring CDSE's baseline capture is a follow-on (TODO). CDSE rows get `boa_add_offset = 0` for now.
- **rslearn Plan B/C** — orthogonal, still parked.

## Design

### 1. `sources/mpc.py` — discovery + download (mirrors CDSE, minus conversion)

- **Discovery**: `pystac_client.Client.open("https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1")`
  with the `planetary_computer` **sign modifier** so returned assets carry SAS-signed HTTPS hrefs;
  search collection `sentinel-2-l2a`, `intersects=ROI`, `datetime=[start,end]`,
  `query={"eo:cloud_cover": {"lt": max_cloudcover}}`. Anonymous; optional
  `PC_SDK_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` env raises rate limits.
- **Asset→band**: MPC keys bands directly (`"B04"`, `"SCL"`, …) — simpler than CDSE's `Bxx_YYm`.
  Map requested `bands` → asset keys; each asset href is a signed COG URL.
- **Download = pure copy**: `storage.transfer(signed_href, dst)` — src is HTTPS (fsspec `http`),
  dst is local (Phase 1). **No `to_cog`, no re-encode** (already COG). The existing atomic
  `.part`+rename in `transfer` gives safe resume (`exists && size>0` skip), same as CDSE.
- **Catalog rows** (mirror `cdse._items_to_gdf` / `_append_downloaded`): `id`, `satellite`
  (`sentinel-2-l2a`), `timestamp` (`item.datetime`, tz-aware UTC), `s3url` (the MPC item href or
  ""), `local_folderpath`, `files`, `cloud_cover` (`eo:cloud_cover`), **`boa_add_offset`**
  (§2), `geometry`. The MGRS tile id comes from `item.properties["s2:mgrs_tile"]` (or the item id).
- **Scope note**: Phase 1 may use a straightforward sequential/threaded download (single tile/band
  is trivial); reusing CDSE's full `download_resume` circuit-breaker orchestration is a Phase-2
  nicety, not required here. `api.download` gains `source: str = "cdse"` and dispatches to
  `sources.mpc.download` when `"mpc"`; `creds` is not required for `source="mpc"` (relax the
  preflight for that branch).

### 2. `boa_add_offset` — derive from `s2:processing_baseline`, store in the catalog

- Add **`boa_add_offset`** (int) to `catalog/catalog.COLUMNS` (before `geometry`, which stays last).
  Backward-compatible: `TileCatalog.read` fills a **missing column with 0** (old catalogs / CDSE).
- Derivation, **per item, keyed on baseline** (not date):
  ```python
  # baseline like "04.00", "05.09", "02.14"
  offset = -1000 if _baseline_tuple(item.properties["s2:processing_baseline"]) >= (4, 0) else 0
  ```
  Stored as the **reflectance-band** offset for the whole tile-row. (The per-band exemption is
  applied at flatten, §3 — SCL/masks are not reflectance.) If `s2:processing_baseline` is missing
  on an item, **raise** (deterministic — no silent 0; this is the correctness-critical field).

### 3. Band-aware application: flatten derives the per-band offset; the builder applies it

- **`builder.flatten_catalog`** gains a per-band **`boa_add_offset`** output column:
  `offset if _is_reflectance(band) else 0`, where `_is_reflectance` = band matches `B01…B12`/`B8A`
  (i.e. `^B\d` or `B8A`); `SCL`, `AOT`, `WVP`, `visual`, … → 0. So each band-flattened row carries
  the exact offset to apply to *that* image.
- **New raster op `raster/ops`-style helper `apply_boa_offset(data, profile, *, offset)`** on the
  locked `(data, profile) -> (data, profile)` convention:
  ```python
  if offset == 0:
      return data, profile
  # upcast to signed to avoid uint16 underflow, align to pre-baseline, clamp, restore dtype
  out = np.clip(data.astype(np.int32) + offset, 0, 65535).astype(data.dtype)
  return out, profile
  ```
  nodata (0) with `offset=-1000` → `clip(-1000,0,·)=0` → stays nodata (order-independent, D2).
- **Applied per source image in the builder's load stage** (in/next to `_add_image_metadata`,
  right after `images.load_images` returns `data_profile_list`, **before** any mosaic op): for each
  non-dropped image `i`, `data_profile_list[i] = apply_boa_offset(*data_profile_list[i],
  offset=catalog_gdf.iloc[i]["boa_add_offset"])`. This guarantees each image is on the pre-baseline
  scale **before** `median_mosaic` collapses a (possibly baseline-straddling) calendar window.
- **Do not** put harmonization in the `ops.run_ops` sequence — that runs on the assembled 5-D cube,
  which is too late (offset is per-source-image, and the median has already mixed baselines).

### 4. Where nothing changes

The catalog query/filter, `area_contribution` multi-tile merge (spec 20), reference-band
resampling (B08), SCL masking, calendar mosaic (spec 15), flatten, and the 5-D band-math contract
are **untouched** — MPC items are the same MGRS granules on the same grid, so the whole
download→datacube→flatten core consumes MPC catalog rows unchanged once §1–§3 land.

## Tests

**pytest (synthetic, no network, deterministic):**
- **baseline→offset** — `_baseline_tuple` parses `"04.00"/"05.09"/"02.14"`; `>= (4,0)` → −1000,
  else 0; a **reprocessed pre-2022 date with baseline 05.xx still yields −1000** (the date-vs-
  baseline trap); missing `s2:processing_baseline` **raises**.
- **flatten band-exemption** — a tile-row with `boa_add_offset=-1000` explodes so `B04` rows carry
  −1000 and `SCL` rows carry 0.
- **`apply_boa_offset` op** — `offset=0` passthrough; `offset=-1000` on a hand-built uint16 array:
  DN 1500→500, DN 500→0 (clamped), DN 0 (nodata)→0; dtype preserved; no uint16 underflow.
- **build-time integration** — a synthetic two-timestamp cube (one "old" image offset 0, one "new"
  image offset −1000, same fabricated tile/band) run through the builder load+mosaic: assert the
  new image is shifted **before** the median, so the mosaic of a baseline-straddling window is
  computed on aligned reflectances (guards the exact #10 failure).
- **catalog back-compat** — reading a parquet without `boa_add_offset` fills 0; round-trip with the
  column preserves it.
- **regression** — full existing suite stays green (CDSE rows default to 0; op is a no-op at 0).

**Runbook (real MPC, user-run, hotspot-friendly) — `runbooks/32-mpc-baseline.md`:**
- One MGRS tile, **band B04 only**, two acquisitions **straddling 2022-01-25** (one baseline <04.00,
  one ≥04.00). Steps: install `.[mpc]`; `download(source="mpc", …)` those two items (tiny COGs);
  assert the **catalog** records `boa_add_offset` 0 and −1000 respectively; build a 2-timestamp
  datacube; assert the harmonized post-baseline slice is DN-shifted vs the raw asset (a spot-check
  pixel), and (visual) the two dates are on a consistent reflectance scale. `_result.json` per spec
  24 with a self-contained `expected` block. No conversion, no scale, hotspot-sized.

## Deliverables (for the Sonnet@medium implement session)

- `sources/mpc.py` (new) — discovery (signed), asset→band, pure-copy download, catalog rows.
- `catalog/catalog.py` — add `boa_add_offset` to `COLUMNS`; read fills missing with 0.
- `datacube/builder.py` — `flatten_catalog` adds per-band `boa_add_offset`; apply `apply_boa_offset`
  per source image in the load stage (before mosaic).
- `datacube/ops.py` (or `raster/…`) — `apply_boa_offset` + `_is_reflectance` helper.
- `api.py` — `download(source="cdse"|"mpc")` dispatch; relax `creds`/preflight for `mpc`.
- `pyproject.toml` — new `[mpc]` extra (`planetary-computer`; `pystac-client` already core).
- `runbooks/32-mpc-baseline.md` (placeholders where needed; hotspot-sized).
- Tests per the Tests section.
- Living docs: `CHANGES.md` (new source; catalog gains `boa_add_offset`; #10 fixed for MPC),
  `DROPPED.md`/none, `TODO.md` (CDSE offset retrofit; Phase-2 stream-vs-copy fork; signed-URL
  re-sign; full `download_resume` orchestration for MPC), `RECIPES.md` (MPC download recipe),
  `specs/31` banner (§5 deleted; retargeted to Phase 2), `specs/10` pointer (MPC = another
  first-class source), `PROGRESS.md`, memory ([[fsd-pipeline-contract]], [[fsd-status]]).

## Best-practice alignment / sources (cross-validated 2026-07-16)

Per-source credit — **exactly what each reliable source contributed to a decision above**:

- **MPC STAC collection JSON**
  (`planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1/collections/sentinel-2-l2a`) — *verified directly*:
  the `B04` (and other band) assets carry `eo:bands`/`gsd`/`type` but **no `raster:bands`** array,
  and `type` is `image/tiff; …profile=cloud-optimized`. **Contributed:** the facts that MPC exposes
  **no per-band offset/scale/nodata in STAC** (→ must derive from `s2:processing_baseline`, §D3/§2)
  and that **assets are COG** (→ pure-copy download, no re-encode, §D1/§1).
- **MPC issue #134 "Sentinel-2 BOA_ADD_OFFSET harmonisation"**
  (`github.com/microsoft/PlanetaryComputer/issues/134`) — **contributed:** MPC **does not
  harmonize** the offset (open, unresolved; GEE/Sentinel-Hub do) and the `BOA_ADD_OFFSET` "lives in
  the product-metadata XML, not easy to read across many images" (→ we own harmonization at build,
  D1; and derive from the cheap `s2:processing_baseline` property rather than parsing MTD XML, §2).
- **MPC dataset page** (`planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-2-l2a`) — **contributed:**
  the collection description (2016→present, Sen2Cor L2A → COG, Azure-hosted) grounding the
  "already-COG on Azure" premise (Motivation, §1).
- **ClearSKY — "Sentinel-2 Scaling & Harmonization"**
  (`clearsky.vision/knowledge/sentinel2-scaling-harmonization`) — **contributed:** the exact scaling
  relation `ρ = (DN + ADD_OFFSET) / QUANTIFICATION_VALUE`, that the per-band add-offset exists only
  since PB 04.00, and that post-baseline DN encodes values down to ~−1000 vs near-zero before (→ the
  harmonization math and the nodata-collision reasoning, §D2/§3).
- **ESA STEP forum — "Changes in band data after 25 Jan 2022 / baseline 04.00 harmonizeValues"**
  (`forum.step.esa.int/t/…/36270`) — **contributed:** the baseline-04.00 cutover date (2022-01-25)
  and that ESA's own `harmonizeValues` aligns new→old by subtracting 1000 (→ D2's "align-to-pre-
  baseline, clamp ≥0" is the ecosystem-standard choice, not an fsd invention).

## Open items to confirm at sign-off / flag for the implementer

- **Exact STAC keys on a live MPC item** — verify `s2:processing_baseline` and `s2:mgrs_tile`
  property names against a real item (the runbook's first download naturally surfaces them).
- **`planetary-computer` signing API** — `pc.sign_inplace` as a `Client(..., modifier=…)` vs signing
  items post-search; pick one and pin the version (mirror the rio-tiler/pin discipline).
- **`http` transport for `transfer`** — confirm `storage.transfer(signed_https, local)` streams via
  the fsspec `http` backend cleanly (large-file streaming, no full in-memory buffer); if not, a
  `/vsicurl`-based or `requests`-stream `get` is the fallback.
- **Non-reflectance band set** — `_is_reflectance` must exempt exactly SCL/AOT/WVP/visual/preview;
  confirm no B-prefixed non-reflectance asset exists in the requested band list.
