"""fsspec-based storage seam + first-class S3-compatible transport.

**Rule: no other module in fsd opens files directly.** Catalog, tiles, datacubes and
training arrays all read and write through here, which is what makes local -> Azure Blob
/ S3 a config change rather than a code change. (The one documented exception is raster
pixel reads, which go through rasterio/GDAL VSI.)

Any S3-compatible store (AWS, CDSE EODATA, MinIO, …) is just an s3fs filesystem
distinguished by `endpoint_url` + keys in `storage_options`, so a tile download is
`transfer(src_s3_url, dst_url)`.

`path` may be a local path or an fsspec URL (`file://`, `s3://`, `az://`, …).
`storage_options` are backend kwargs, e.g. for CDSE S3::

    {"key": access, "secret": secret,
     "client_kwargs": {"endpoint_url": config.CDSE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL}}
