"""Public collection registry -- `fsd.collections.register()` / `.get()`.

Spec: specs/58-collection-agnostic-verbs.md D2, D13. ADR 0030, 0031.

Per-collection facts (bands, mask, radiometry, grid) live here, keyed by STAC collection
id, rather than hardcoded into a source module. Built-in collections register themselves
at import time (`s2_l2a`); a caller's own variant calls `register()` directly -- no entry
points, no packaging, no image rebuild.

**The registry is consulted ONLY on the driver.** A `collection=` string is resolved to a
`CollectionDeclaration` here, in-process, before any work is dispatched; the resolved
declaration then travels as JSON in a control file under the run folder
(`fsd.workflows.create_datacube.setup` writes it). A node reads that file -- it never
imports this module to resolve a collection string, because this registry is a plain
in-process dict that does not exist inside a fresh AML job container (ADR 0031).
